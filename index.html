              Hello, I'm dungeon master chef. I've been a professional dungeon master for over two years now and enjoy doing this. I 
              started doing this when I had slowly started to transition from being a chef to being a butcher. It gave me more time to 
              enjoy Dungeons & Dragons, and also to run a few games a week professionally. Since then, I have gone back to working in restaurants
              and that does limit my availability to run games. I'm definitely still around and enjoying a few campaigns a week, but I'm definitely
              not a full-time dungeon master anymore.<br><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              I like to run my games with some professionalism. You will notice that the Discord Server & the documents I wrote up to help answer
              questions more fast and efficiently are designed around making sure all your questions are answered and adjusted as I continue to do this.
              My goal is to treat my Dungeon Mastering services like a professional business, rather than a guy with a hobby who figured out how to make money
              to support his hobbies. Even though that's the case and the money does support the very hefty costs of being a dungeon master, I like to run a
              professional business with an easy way to sign up and get started.
              <br>

            <p>
              We support working-breed dogs by donating a percentage of the income from our campaigns and 
              one-shots. Unfortunately, it&apos;s become common for people to “fall in love” with working breeds 
              through social media, only to later realize how much care, structure, and effort these dogs truly 
              require. They aren&apos;t just house pets — they need purpose, training, and commitment. Because of this 
              misunderstanding, and issues like reactivity that often stem from improper handling, working breeds 
              are frequently surrendered and end up in shelters alongside other breeds that receive an unfair 
              reputation through no fault of their own.
              <br><br>
              This is <b>Brutus</b>, a 12-year-old German Shepherd. From what I understand, he was surrendered 
              due to a move. It happens, and I get it. But giving up isn&apos;t an option for me. When I found a 
              rescue that shared that same mindset — never giving up on these dogs — I was inspired to dedicate a 
              portion of our income to supporting their work rescuing German Shepherds.
              <br><br>
              Someone has to be their hero, right?
              <br><br>
              Brutus is a fortunate case. Many others come with far worse stories. I always rescue when I can and 
              never buy from breeders — not only because it aligns with my values, but because working breeds are 
              the dogs I prefer to train with and advocate for.
              <br><br>
              So just know that when you join our campaigns, part of what you&apos;re contributing goes directly toward
               helping dogs like Brutus — and supporting the rescue, rehabilitation, and future of working-breed 
               dogs.
